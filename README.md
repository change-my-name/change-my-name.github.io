# Change-My-Name

Change my name is a website created to list 
various websites and provide information on 
how to change your name on each of them, if 
you can.  It also serves to show the wide range 
still present in how large websites handle names, 
and how far behind many are.  Making the list easy 
to update was a consideration from the start, as the 
list will never be complete but with more people 
involved it can cover a larger number of websites. 
To this end there are GitHub issue templates to allow 
simple plain text descriptions to be referenced, and a 
website can be added to the list by editing a simple 
JSON file, no HTML needed.  If you know something missing, 
create an issue or pull request and add it to the list!
