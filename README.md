# Change-My-Name

Change-My-Name is a regularly maintained catalogue of various webservices and social media outlets, that details which services allow users to edit personal information, in particular, to change your name. We'll even show you how!

May this project stand to unveil the vast amount of sites that poorly handle names, so they may self-correct and provide a safe environment for their users to express their personal identity. The ability to edit identifying information while still retaining personal data (i.e. not making a new account) is especially appreciated in the trans community, where your name is both a personal identification and an outwardly expressive experience.

Keeping this list current and maintainable has always been in the project scope; A list like this will, in the end, never be complete. The more people who involve themselves in this project, the longer the list will be! We need your help.

To this end, GitHub's **_Issue Templates_** will serve as the primary project contribution method. Use this feature to input a plain text description of the capabilities of a new website that you've found! In the end, _someone_ will be editing the main JSON file, containing all the data on websites that we've collected. If you know of a site or service not on this list, create an issue or pull request to contribute how you see fit!
